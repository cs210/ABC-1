# Ionic 4 News App

News app in Ionic 4

## Getting started

* Install the ionic CLI globally: `npm install -g ionic`
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/cs210/ABC-1.git`.
* Run `npm install` from the app directory.
* Run `npm install node-sass` from the app directory.

## Running in an emulator

Some Ionic features only work in a native build which is why we recommend running in an ios emulator (requires Mac) to get full functionality. 

To run an ios emulator:
* `ionic cordova run ios`

If unable to run on an emulator, run on web:
* `ionic serve -- --proxy-config src/proxy.conf.json`
